AI Storyboard Creator for Films — generate illustrated scene plans + dialogue timing + camera angles 

 

1) Product Description & Presentation 

One-liner 

“Transform a script into a fully illustrated storyboard: scene breakdowns, dialogue timing, camera angles, and shot composition—ready for directors and crews.” 

What it produces 

Scene breakdowns with slug lines, action, dialogue timing, and shot lists. 

Illustrated frames (AI-generated concept art, sketch, or animatic stills) per shot. 

Camera plans: angle, movement, lens, framing notes. 

Dialogue overlays: when each line is spoken, synced to beats. 

Exports: PDF storyboard booklets, image sequences, MP4 animatics with audio, JSON bundle (scenes/shots/dialogue/camera metadata). 

Scope/Safety 

Creative tool only, not replacing DPs, directors, or artists. 

Keeps generated art in conceptual/sketch style unless configured with branded assets. 

Outputs always reference script timecodes and shot metadata for traceability. 

 

2) Target User 

Directors & filmmakers planning visual storytelling. 

Cinematographers & crew aligning on lenses, angles, and movements. 

Storyboard artists accelerating drafts with AI pre-visualizations. 

Screenwriters wanting quick previews of pacing and scene flow. 

Production teams creating animatics for funding, pitching, or pre-shoot planning. 

 

3) Features & Functionalities (Extensive) 

Ingestion & Script Parsing 

Upload screenplays (Final Draft .fdx, Fountain, PDF, TXT). 

Scene slug parsing: INT/EXT, location, time of day. 

Action vs dialogue segmentation. 

Timecode alignment (if script-to-audio track provided). 

Scene & Shot Breakdown 

Scene cards: location, characters, beats, estimated runtime. 

Shot lists: camera setup, angle, framing, lens suggestion, movement. 

Dialogue timing: per line, with estimated duration. 

Blocking suggestions: character positions, entrances/exits. 

Visual Illustration 

Frame sketches: AI generates illustration per shot (line art, storyboard style). 

Style presets: sketch/greyscale, concept art, cinematic lighting. 

Camera overlays: safe zones, thirds grid, shot size annotation. 

Optional animatics: stills + dialogue TTS/audio synced to pacing. 

Camera & Technical Notes 

Shot size: CU, MS, LS, OTS, POV. 

Camera movement: pan, tilt, dolly, crane, drone. 

Lens: focal length recommendation, DOF estimate. 

Lighting cues: high key, low key, natural, practical. 

Views & Reports 

Storyboard viewer: scroll scenes → expand shots → illustrated frames. 

Shot list table: CSV-style list of shots with lens/angle/duration. 

Dialogue timeline: speech balloons/timecodes synced to story. 

Animatic preview: MP4 with auto-captioned dialogue. 

Collaboration & Governance 

Projects & roles (Owner/Director/Artist/Viewer). 

Comments per scene/shot. 

Version control for alternative storyboards (e.g., “Action cut” vs “Romantic cut”). 

Export snapshots locked with metadata + audit log. 

 

4) Backend Architecture (Extremely Detailed & Deployment-Ready) 

4.1 Topology 

Frontend/BFF: Next.js 14 (Vercel). SSR for storyboard preview; ISR for shared links. 

API Gateway: NestJS (Node 20) — REST /v1, Zod validation, RBAC, RLS, Problem+JSON. 

Workers (Python 3.11 + FastAPI controller) 

script-worker (parse .fdx/Fountain/PDF, extract scenes & dialogue). 

shot-worker (scene → shot list, camera metadata). 

illustration-worker (AI image gen: sketch/storyboard frames). 

dialogue-worker (timing estimate; optional TTS audio). 

animatic-worker (render MP4 with stills+audio). 

export-worker (PDF/CSV/JSON/ZIP). 

Event bus/queues: NATS (script.ingest, shot.breakdown, illustration.make, dialogue.sync, animatic.make, export.make) + Redis Streams. 

Datastores: 

Postgres 16 (projects, scripts, shots, camera metadata). 

S3/R2 (storyboard frames, animatics, exports). 

Redis (session, job states). 

Optional: Neo4j (character/scene graph). 

Observability: OpenTelemetry + Prometheus/Grafana; Sentry. 

Secrets: Cloud KMS; AI model API keys; tenant encryption.

CI/CD: GitHub Actions (lint/typecheck/unit/integration, Docker, scan, deploy); blue/green; migration approvals. 

IaC: Terraform for DB/Redis/NATS/buckets/CDN/secrets. 

Envs: dev/staging/prod. 

Operational SLOs 

Script parse (120 pages) < 15s p95. 

Frame generation per shot < 8s p95 (GPU). 

Animatic render (3 min) < 60s p95. 

PDF export < 5s p95. 

 

8) Testing 

Unit: slug parsing accuracy; dialogue extraction; shot suggestion templates. 

Integration: script → scenes → shots → frames → animatic. 

E2E: upload screenplay → auto-generate storyboard → export PDF + MP4 animatic. 

Load: 1000+ shots with frames; batch exports. 

Chaos: corrupted PDF, GPU outage, image-gen timeout. 

Security: RLS enforcement; signed URL scope. 

 

9) Success Criteria 

Product KPIs 

Time-to-first storyboard draft (120p script) < 20 min median. 

Director satisfaction (first-pass accuracy of shot types) ≥ 70%. 

Frame replacement rate by humans ≤ 40% (drafts considered useful). 

User satisfaction ≥ 4.3/5. 

Engineering SLOs 

Pipeline success ≥ 99% excl. bad uploads. 

Render/export error rate < 1%. 

SSE/WS drop rate < 0.5%. 

 

10) Visual/Logical Flows 

A) Script → Scenes 

 Upload screenplay → parse slug lines, actions, dialogues → generate scene cards. 

B) Scenes → Shots 

 Scene → auto-generate shot list (angles, sizes, lenses) → populate dialogue timings. 

C) Shots → Frames 

 AI illustration worker → sketch frames → camera grid overlays. 

D) Shots → Animatic 

 Frames + dialogue (TTS or sync) → animatic MP4 with captions & music. 

E) Export 

 Output storyboard booklets (PDF), shotlist CSV, animatic MP4, JSON bundle for NLE import.
