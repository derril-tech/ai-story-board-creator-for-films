- [x] [SRE] DLQ + retries with jitter; worker autoscale; GPU cache warmers.
- [x] [BE] RLS enforcement tests; signed URL TTLs; rate limits; content filters for unsafe imagery.
- [x] [FE][A11Y] Accessibility: keyboard timeline nav; SR labels for frames/shots; high-contrast themes; localization pass.
- [x] [PM] Versioning of storyboards (alt cuts), comments per scene/shot; audit log surfacing.
- [x] [QA] E2E: upload screenplay → auto storyboards → edit timings → regenerate frames → export PDF/MP4/JSON; load/chaos tests.
